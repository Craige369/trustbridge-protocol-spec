# Security Architecture

**TrustBridge Protocol — Threat Model and Required Defences**

> This document is the security specification for TrustBridge Protocol. It defines known attack vectors, required defences, and immutable security decisions. It is published openly as a signal of intent and to hold the development team accountable to the stated architecture.

## Critical context — the Bybit attack (February 2025)

In February 2025, Lazarus Group (North Korean state actors) stole $1.5 billion from Bybit. They did not exploit the smart contract. The contract was correct. They injected malicious JavaScript into the Safe signing UI — the frontend interface Bybit's authorised signers used to approve transactions. Signers saw one transaction on screen and signed a completely different one. By the time anyone identified the discrepancy, the funds were gone.

**This is now the primary attack vector for any Safe-powered application that moves user funds.**

TrustBridge's `ConfirmDeliveryModal` is a direct architectural response. Before any fund release, both parties independently view a human-readable summary of the exact transaction — asset amounts, wallet addresses, deal reference — and must tick an acknowledgment checkbox before the confirm button activates. The modal cannot be dismissed by clicking outside or pressing Escape. It fires for every release action, for every party, for every deal, with no exceptions.

This is documented as an immutable design decision. It cannot be removed, bypassed, or simplified in any version of TrustBridge for any reason.

## Threat model

### CRITICAL — Smart contract layer

| Threat | Attack description | Required defence | Status |
|--------|-------------------|-----------------|--------|
| **Reentrancy** | Malicious contract calls back into TrustBridgeDeal before state is updated, draining the vault repeatedly | `ReentrancyGuard` on ALL fund-moving functions. State updated BEFORE all transfers (checks-effects-interactions). Non-negotiable on every function that moves assets. | Specified — to be implemented in Phase 2 |
| **Price oracle manipulation** | Attacker manipulates price feed to trigger false price band breach or prevent legitimate release | Chainlink price oracle ONLY for on-chain band verification at `releaseFunds()`. CoinGecko is UI display only — never used in contract logic. | Specified — non-negotiable |
| **Precision loss / integer overflow** | Rounding errors in fee calculation create exploitable edge cases | Solidity 0.8.x built-in overflow protection. Fee calculation uses basis points (integer arithmetic). | Specified |
| **Token whitelist bypass** | Attacker uses a malicious ERC-20 token with non-standard behaviour | Approved token whitelist enforced at `createDeal()`. `SafeERC20` handles non-standard tokens including tokens with return value issues. | Specified |
| **Front-running** | Attacker front-runs `releaseFunds()` to manipulate outcome | 2-of-2 requirement means attacker would need control of one party's wallet. Commit-reveal not required for this architecture. | Acceptable risk |
| **Griefing / DoS** | Party A creates many deals to prevent Party B from acting | Gas costs disincentivise spam. Future: rate limiting per address. | Known limitation — to be addressed in v2 |

---

### HIGH — Frontend / signing layer

| Threat | Attack description | Required defence | Status |
|--------|-------------------|-----------------|--------|
| **UI spoofing (Bybit vector)** | Malicious JS injected into signing UI — user signs different transaction than displayed | `ConfirmDeliveryModal` — mandatory human-readable summary before every release. Both parties. Every deal. Cannot be removed. | Implemented in prototype — must be preserved in production |
| **Phishing via typo domain** | Attacker registers trust-bridge.io, trustbr1dge.xyz etc. to harvest wallet signatures | Register defensive domains. HSTS on all TrustBridge domains. EIP-712 signed messages display domain name in wallet — mismatch is immediately visible. | Partially complete — additional domains to be registered before mainnet |
| **Malicious JS dependency** | Compromised npm package injects malicious code | SRI (Subresource Integrity) hashes on all external scripts. `npm audit` in CI pipeline. Dependabot for dependency updates. Minimal dependency footprint. | To be implemented in Phase 2 |
| **Fake invite link** | Attacker sends a spoofed invite link pointing to a phishing site | Invite links contain cryptographic deal reference. Party B pre-connection preview shows terms — mismatch between expected and displayed terms is detectable. | Partially implemented — full cryptographic signing in Phase 2 |

---

### MEDIUM — Infrastructure and configuration

| Threat | Attack description | Required defence | Status |
|--------|-------------------|-----------------|--------|
| **PlanSwitcher in production** | Prototype-only plan switching tool accidentally left in production build | `PlanSwitcher.jsx` must be removed entirely from production build. Plan determined by authenticated user account only. | Known prototype limitation — documented in Known Limitations Register |
| **Hardcoded deal IDs** | Prototype uses hardcoded #0042 — collision or confusion in production | Server-generated unique IDs from deal creation events before any production deployment. | Known prototype limitation |
| **In-memory dealStore** | Prototype state lost on page refresh — audit trail not persisted | Replace dealStore.js with Supabase/PlanetScale backend with row-level security before testnet. Append-only admin audit log. | Known prototype limitation |
| **Admin key compromise** | Single admin wallet for `resolveDispute()` is a centralisation risk | Multi-sig admin wallet from day one. Kleros decentralised arbitration in v2 removes admin dependency entirely. | Specified — to be implemented |
| **Fee wallet compromise** | Platform fee wallet is a single point of failure | Multi-sig fee wallet. Fee withdrawal requires multiple signatures. | Specified |

---

### LOW — Protocol design

| Threat | Attack description | Required defence | Status |
|--------|-------------------|-----------------|--------|
| **Dust attack** | Attacker creates many tiny deals to pollute state | Minimum deal value enforcement. Gas costs disincentivise at current fee levels. | To be added to `createDeal()` validation |
| **Dispute abuse** | Party abuses dispute mechanism to delay release | Dispute deposit ($20 flat / 1% above $10K) disincentivises frivolous disputes. 7-day max resolution window. Winner receives dispute deposit back. | Specified and implemented in prototype |
| **Time manipulation** | Miner manipulates block timestamp to affect expiry | Solidity `block.timestamp` is within ~15 seconds of real time — acceptable for minimum 30-minute deals. Not exploitable at TrustBridge deal durations. | Acceptable risk |

---

## Immutable security decisions

These decisions are permanent. They cannot be changed for any user, operator, plan tier, deal size, or business reason:

### 1. ConfirmDeliveryModal — never removable

Both parties must independently verify the exact transaction details before any fund release. The modal fires for every release action, for every party, on every deal. It cannot be dismissed without an explicit choice. It cannot be bypassed for any tier or deal type.

**Rationale:** This is TrustBridge's primary defence against the Bybit attack vector. The $1.5B loss happened because users trusted what the UI showed them without verifying. This modal forces verification.

### 2. Non-custodial architecture — absolute

TrustBridge cannot access, freeze, move, or confiscate user funds under any circumstance. No admin function exists that can override the 2-of-2 requirement while a deal is in `LOCKED` state. The only exceptions are `resolveDispute()` (requires both parties to have filed or been filed against) and `claimRefund()` (permissionless after expiry).

### 3. Chainlink oracle — on-chain only

CoinGecko and similar off-chain price APIs can be manipulated, rate-limited, or go offline. Chainlink's decentralised oracle network is the only acceptable source for on-chain price band verification at `releaseFunds()`. CoinGecko is acceptable for UI display only and is clearly marked as such in all documentation.

### 4. Checks-effects-interactions — always

State is always updated before any external call or token transfer. No exceptions on any fund-moving function. This is the standard protection against reentrancy and must be enforced by the auditing firm as a pass/fail criterion.

### 5. Time-lock auto-refund — no admin override

When the deal timer expires, `claimRefund()` is callable by anyone and returns both deposits automatically. No admin function can prevent this. No admin function can extend the timer after the deal is in `LOCKED` state without both parties' consent.

## Audit requirements

Before any mainnet deployment, TrustBridge Protocol requires a professional security audit covering:

**Scope:**
- All functions in TrustBridgeDeal.sol
- State machine integrity — all valid and invalid transitions
- All fund-moving functions with special attention to reentrancy
- Fee calculation edge cases
- Oracle integration and manipulation resistance
- Access control (admin functions, party-specific functions)
- Event emission completeness

**Required audit firms:** CertiK, Trail of Bits, OpenZeppelin, or equivalent recognised firm. Self-audits are not acceptable.

**Pass criteria:**
- Zero critical findings unresolved
- Zero high findings unresolved
- All medium findings resolved or documented with accepted risk
- Audit report published publicly

**The prototype will not move to production without a clean audit report.**

## Known prototype limitations (security-relevant)

The following prototype limitations are security-relevant and must be resolved before any real funds are involved:

| Item | Risk | Resolution |
|------|------|-----------|
| Simulated wallet connection | No real transaction signing | Replace with Wagmi + viem in Phase 2 |
| In-memory dealStore | Deal state lost on refresh | Replace with authenticated Supabase backend |
| Hardcoded deal IDs | No uniqueness guarantee | Server-generated IDs from contract events |
| PlanSwitcher.jsx present | Any user can switch to Enterprise | Remove entirely from production build |
| CoinGecko price display | Simulated — not live in prototype | Wire to live CoinGecko API for display; Chainlink for contract logic |
| No KYC threshold enforcement | Deals above UAE VARA threshold not flagged | KYC process design required before Pro plan mainnet |

See [KNOWN_LIMITATIONS.md](KNOWN_LIMITATIONS.md) for the complete register.

## Data security

| Data type | Retention | Storage | Encryption |
|-----------|-----------|---------|-----------|
| Deal chat messages | 2 years (completed) / 8 years (disputed) | Supabase (off-chain) | AES-256 at rest |
| Dispute evidence | 8 years | Supabase (off-chain) | AES-256 + SHA-256 fingerprint |
| Platform fee records | 8 years | Append-only audit log | Standard |
| User email (optional) | Until deletion request | Supabase | Standard |
| IP addresses | 90 days | Hashed only | SHA-256 |
| Real identity / KYC | Not collected at MVP | — | — |
| Behavioural analytics | Never collected | — | — |

All on-chain data is public by nature. Users should be aware that deal creation, deposit, release, and dispute events are permanently visible on the blockchain.
